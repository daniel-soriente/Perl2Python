<p>
This assignment aims to give you:
</p><ul>
<li> practice in Perl programming generally
</li><li> experience in translating between complex formats with Perl
</li><li> introduce you to Python semantics &amp; clarify your understanding of Perl semantics
</li></ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> the material in the lecture notes will not be sufficient
by itself to allow you to complete this assignment.
You may need to search on-line documentation for Perl etc.
Being able to search documentation efficiently for the information you need is a
<em>very</em> useful skill for any kind of computing work.

</p><h4>Introduction</h4>

Your task in this assignment to write a Perl compiler.
Generally compilers take a high level language as input
and output assembler, which can then can be directly executed.
Your compiler will take a Perl script as input and output a Python script.
Such a translation is useful because  
programmers sometimes need to convert Perl  scripts to Python.
<p>
Possible reasons for this include integration of existing Perl code
into a Python program and shifting a complete Perl prgram to a new platform which requires Python,
such as Google's app engine.
</p><p>
Your task in this assignment
is to automate this conversion.  You must write a Perl program which
takes as input a Perl script and outputs an equivalent Python program.
</p><p>
The translation of some Perl code to Python is straightforward.
The translation of other Perl code is difficult or infeasible.
So your program will not be able to translate all Perl code to Python.
But a tool that  performs only a partial translation of Perl to Python
could still be very useful.
</p><p>
You should assume the Python code output by your program will
be subsequently read and modified by humans.  In other word
you have to output readable Python code.  For example, you should
aim to preserve variable names and comments, and to output
properly indented Python code. 
</p><p>
You must write your translator in Perl (for assignment 2 there will be no restriction on language).
</p><p>
You should call your Perl program <tt>perl2python</tt>.  It should
operate as Unix filters typically do, read files specified on the command line
and if none are specified it should read from standard input (Perl's &lt;&gt; operator
does this for you).  For example:
</p><pre>% cat iota.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl
$x = 1;
while ($x &lt; 5) {
	print "$x\n";
	$x = $x + 1;
}
% perl iota.pl
0
1
2
3
4
% ./perl2python iota.pl|python
0
1
2
3
4
% ./perl2python iota.pl &gt;iota.py
% cat iota.py
#!/usr/bin/python
x = 1
while x &lt;  5:
    print x
    x = x + 1
% python iota.py
0
1
2
3
4
</pre>
<p>
In many cases the natural translation of Perl code into Python code will have
slightly different semantics.  For example, Python's <tt>print</tt> statement will
print an initial space if the preceding character printed was not a new line - Perl's <tt>print</tt>
does not do  this.  Python's (pre-3.0) division operator (/) truncates its result to an integer if
given two integer arguments .  Perl does not.
</p><p>
This is a general issue with translating between languages.
It is essential that a compiler such as <tt>gcc</tt> produce a translation to assembler
exactly matching the semantics of the program, but our purposes are different.
</p><p>
Our goal is to provide automated-assistance in converting a piece of software.
The software will need to subsequently maintained and modified by humans 
so the simpler natural translation to more human-readable code 
is more desirable even if the semantics do not match exactly.
Translation of large piece of software will not be completely automatic
anyway and will require subsequent manual modification.
</p><p>
</p><h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>
To assist you tackling the assignments requirements have been broken into subsets in
approximate order of difficulty.  Each subset contains the previous subsets.
This implementation order is recommended not required.  You will receive marks
for successfully translating features regardless of which subset they are in,
even if previous subsets are unimplemented.

Some features in subset 5 present great difficulties to translation
perfect handling of these will not be required for full marks.

</p><h6>Not Included</h6>

The features you need implement are described in the subsets above
so, for example, you don't have to translate these Perl features:

<p>
</p><h4>Assumptions/Clarifications</h4>
Like all good programmers, you should make as few assumptions about
your input as possible.
<p>
You can assume that the input to your program is a valid Perl program
and it executes without error.
</p><p>
It is possible to format Perl
programs so that they are difficult to translate.
Most of the  Perl programs your program will be given will be formated
in a similar way to use for lecture and lab examples.  But your should attempt to successfully
translate at least small variations to that style and preferably any formatting style
that a reasonable Perl programmer is likely to use.
</p><p>
It is possible to construct obscure and difficult to translate Perl
programs using the features list in the above subsets.
Most of the  Perl programs your program will be given as input will use the features
in an obvious straight-forward  manner.
</p><p>
</p><p>
You may use any Perl package which is installed on CSE's system.
</p><p>
You may submit multiple  files but the primary file must be named <tt>perl2python</tt>.
</p><p>
If there is Perl that you cannot translate the preferred  behaviour is to
include the untranslated Perl construct as a comment.  Other sensible behaviour is acceptable.

</p><h4>Hints</h4>
You should follow  discussion about the assignment in the
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~forums/support/viewforum.php?f=1190">course forum</a>.
Questions about the assignment should be posted there so all students can see the
lecturer's answer.
If you need an urgent reply also e-mail the lecturer.
<p>
</p><h4>Demo &amp; Test Inputs</h4>

You should submit ten Perl scripts named <tt>demo00.pl .. demo09.pl</tt>
which your program translates correctly (or at least well).
These should be realistic Perl scripts containing features whose
successful translation indicates the performance of your assignment.
Your demo scripts don't have to be original, e.g. they might be lecture examples.
If they are not original they should be correctly attributed.
<p>
You should submit ten Perl scripts named <tt>test00.pl .. test09.py</tt>
which test single aspects of translation.
They should be short scripts containing Perl code belonging to the subsets  for this
assignment, which are likely to be good tests of a Python to Perl translator.
In other words they are examples of Perl a student assignment might mis-translate.
The <tt>test??.pl</tt> scripts do not have to be examples that your program translates successfully.
</p><p>
In summary the demo scripts should show off your translation - they can be long and
test many aspects of Perl to Python translation.  The test scripts should show how you've
thought about testing carefully - and they should be short and each test only a few
aspects of Perl to Python translation.

p&gt;
</p><h4>Getting Started</h4>
Here is the <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/13s2/assignments/perl2python/perl2python.level0">source</a> to a Perl script which
translates  correctly a very small amount of Python to Perl including
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/13s2/assignments/perl2python/examples/0/hello_world.pl">examples//0/hello_world.pl</a>.
For example:
<p>
</p><pre>% d=/home/cs2041/public_html/assignments/perl2python/
% cp $d/perl2python.level0 perl2python
% ln -s $d/examples .
% perl examples/0/hello_world.pl
hello world
% perl2python examples/0/hello_world.pl &gt;h.py
% perl h.py
hello world
%
</pre>
<p>
</p><h4>Version History &amp; Diary</h4>
You need to maintain a version history for your assignment in a git repository.
You should submit this in a tar file <tt>git.tar</tt>.
<p>
Git will be covered later in lectures but here is a quick tutorial on the
what to do:
</p><pre>% mkdir -p 2041/ass1
% chmod 700 2041/ass1
% cd 2041/ass1
% git init
Initialized empty Git repository in ...
% cp /home/cs2041/public_html/assignments/perl2python/perl2python.level0 perl2python
% git add perl2python
% git commit -a -m 'starting point'
....
% vi perl2python
% git commit -a -m 'added code to handle while loops'
....
% vi perl2python
% git commit -a -m 'fix bug with formatting'
....
% ....
% ....
% ....
% git commit -a -m 'tidied up assignment for submission'
% tar jcf git.tar .git
% give cs2041 ass1 perl2python diary.txt git.tar test??.py demo??.py 
</pre>
<p>  
You must keep notes of each piece of you make work on this assignment.
The notes should include date, starting&amp;finishing time, and a brief description of
the work carried out.
For example:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tbody><tr><th>Date</th><th>Start</th><th>Stop</th><th>Activity</th><th>Comments
</th></tr><tr><td>29/09</td><td>16:00</td><td>17:30</td><td>coding</td><td>implemented for loop
</td></tr><tr><td>30/09</td><td>20:00</td><td>10:30</td><td>debugging</td><td>found bug in string handing
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
Include these notes in the files you submit as diary.txt.
</p><p>
You may choose to store this information in git commit messages.
and generate  <tt>diary.txt</tt> from <tt>git log</tt> before you submit.

</p><h4>Getting Started</h4>
Here is the <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041/13s2/assignments/perl2python/perl2python.pl">source</a> to a Perl script which

<p>
You need to maintain a version history for your assignment in a git repository
which you should submit in a tar file named <tt>git.tar</tt>.
</p><p>
Git will be covered later in lectures but the above commands
are enough to get by.


</p><h4>Assessment</h4>
<p>
Assignment 1 will contribute 15 marks to your final COMP2041/9041 mark
</p><p>
15% of the marks for assignment 1 will come from hand marking.  These marks will be awarded on the basis of clarity, 
commenting, elegance and style.  In other words, you will be assessed on how
easy it is for a human to read and understand your program.
</p><p>
5% of the marks for stage 1 will be based on the test suite you submit.
</p><p>
80% of the marks for assignment 1 will come from your translators 
performance on a  set of input Perl programs.
</p><p>
</p>
&lt;<table border="1"><tbody><tr><td align="right">100%</td><td>Subsets 0-4 handled perfectly, subset 5 largely working, Perl is beautiful
</td></tr><tr><td align="right">90%</td><td>Subsets 0-4 handled, Perl is very clear &amp; very readable
</td></tr><tr><td align="right">75%</td><td>Subsets 0-3 handled, Perl is good clear code 
</td></tr><tr><td align="right">65</td><td>Subsets 0-2 handled, Perl is reasonably readable 
</td></tr><tr><td align="right">55%</td><td>Subset 0-1 translated more-or-less

</td></tr><tr><td align="right">0 FL for COMP2041/9041</td><td>Submitting any other person's work.  This includes joint work.
</td></tr><tr><td>academic<br>misconduct</td><td>Submitting another person's work without their consent.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
</p><p>
The lecturer may vary the assessment scheme after inspecting
the assignment submissions but its likely to be broadly similar to the above.

</p><h2>Originality of Work</h2>
<p>
The work you submit must be your own work.  Submission of work partially or completely derived
from any other person or jointly written with any other person is not permitted.
The penalties for such an offence may include negative marks,
automatic failure of the course and possibly other academic discipline.
Assignment submissions will be examined both automatically and manually
for such submissions.
</p><p>
Relevant scholarship authorities will be informed if students holding scholarships
are involved in an incident of plagiarism or other misconduct.
</p><p>
Do not provide or show your assignment work to any other person - apart from the teaching staff
of COMP2041/9041.
If you knowingly provide or show your assignment work to another person for any
reason, and work derived from it is submitted you may be penalized, even
if the work was submitted without your knowledge or consent.  This may
apply even if your work is submitted by a third party unknown to you.
</p><p>
Note, you will not be penalized if your work is
taken without your consent or knowledge.
</p><p>
</p><h2>Submission</h2>
<p>
This assignment is  due at 23:59pm Monday October 7
Submit the assignment using this <i>give</i> command:
</p><p>
</p><pre>	tar jcf  git.tar .git
    give cs2041 ass1 perl2python.pl diary.txt git.tar demo??.py test??.py [any-other-files]
 </pre>
<p>
If your assignment is submitted after this date, each hour it is late reduces
the maximum mark it can achieve by 1%.
For example if an assignment worth 76% was submitted
12 hours late, the late submission would have no effect.
If the same assignment was submitted 36 hours late it would be awarded
64%, the maximum mark it can achieve at that date.
